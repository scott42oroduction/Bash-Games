# Bash-Games
A simple game, with some useful functions in it.

This bash shell script helped me learn scripting.

I'm making it public to help others to learn shell 

scripting and have fun. If you want to add to or

fix the game just keep it strictly in script 

language, no external programs or binary helpers.

Many other shell script pieces were taken from.

Copy the code and run it in terminal 

'nano moonbuggy.sh'
#//copy code into and save
#//change it to runnable 
'chmod +x moonbuggy.sh'
#// to run
'bash moonbuggy.sh'
#//or try
'./moonbuggy.sh'

Use the code freely or change it or add to it. Go nuts!
